    <h1>TFT Scouter</h1>

    <h2>Matchmaking Explanation</h2>
    <p>We can scout possible opponents in TFT using the matchmaking system explained in <a target="_blank" href="https://giantslayer.tv/blogs/1349256428/explaining-tfts-hidden-systems-and-how-to-use-them-to-your-advantage/">this article by Naturesbf</a>. To summarize:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>At <strong>8</strong> players left, you cannot play the last <strong>4</strong>.</li>
        <li>At <strong>7</strong> players left, you cannot play the last <strong>3</strong>.</li>
        <li>At <strong>6</strong> and <strong>5</strong> players left, you cannot play the last <strong>2</strong>.</li>
        <li>At <strong>4</strong> players left, you cannot play the last player you fought when there were still five. The next rounds will be round robin, meaning you will play everyone once in the next three rounds. There are no ghosts this round.</li>
        <li>At <strong>3</strong> players left, you can play any of the remaining players. Over the first three rounds, you will play each player once and one ghost, in some order. This order will repeat until someone dies (although the ghost will change players).</li>
        <li>At <strong>2</strong> players left, you can only play the remaining opponent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After someone has died, ghosts begin to appear. The ghost can be anyone from the pool of live players, and does not remove that player from your pool of possible opponents. However, the ghost does count as an opponent, meaning you won't play a ghost again until however many rounds have passed. This means the oldest player in your played pool will become a possible opponent again. When a ghost is a possible opponent, you can technically face anyone; however, assuming ghosts have an even probility of each alive player, it is more likely to face someone from the available pool.</p>

    <h2>Using the Scouter</h2>
    <p>Enter the names of the other players in the game. At the start, all the players will be added to the available pool. Each round, click on the player in the available pool that you face, which will move the player to the unavailable pool. When a player dies, click on the player at the top in the player pool. This will remove them from the available and unavailable pool, and add a ghost to the available pool. The oldest player in the unavailable pool will be moved back to the available pool if appropriate.</p>
